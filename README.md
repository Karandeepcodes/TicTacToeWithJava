# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a simple game created using JavaFX. It allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ("X" or "O") on a 3x3 game board. The game ends when one player wins or there is a draw.

## Installation

To run the game, you will need to have JavaFX installed on your machine. You can download JavaFX from https://openjfx.io/ or Alternatively download Librica JDK 11 that comes bundled with javaFx.

After downloading and installing the necessary dependencies, you can run the game by executing the `TicTacToe.java` file in your IDE.

## Usage

To play the game, simply click on an empty button on the game board to place your symbol. The game will automatically switch turns between players. If a player wins, a message will be displayed and the game will end. If the game ends in a draw, a different message will be displayed and the game will end.
